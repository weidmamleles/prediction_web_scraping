# prediction_web_scraping
The objective of the work is to forecast the prices of rooms for two people in Bangkok for the hotels available on Booking.com

The pages of the Booking website were web scraped for stays from December 23 to 24, 2020 in the city of Bangkok, extracting 1976 observations.

Throughout this work, several forecast models were developed, however, in the light of the results obtained in terms of RRMSE and RMSE, we continued with 15 models for the evaluation to be carried out.

The best model, in terms of RMSE, is the Artificial Neural Network with Backpropagation, followed by the Neural Network (Rprop) and the Multiple Linear Regression without binary variables (except breakfast), without amount of reviews and dummy on Stars and distance.
